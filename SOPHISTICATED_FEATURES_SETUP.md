# Sophisticated Features Setup Guide

This guide covers the setup for the enhanced project tracking system, email notifications, and community activity feed.

## üöÄ Features Overview

### 1. Sophisticated Project Tracker
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: SVG progress rings and gradient status indicators
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically filters out completed projects from dashboard
- **Real-time Stats**: Active projects, completion rates, overdue tracking
- **Enhanced Cards**: Status-based gradients, hover animations, deadline warnings

### 2. SendGrid Email Notifications
- **Project Created**: Beautiful HTML emails sent when projects are assigned
- **Project Completed**: Celebration emails with next steps when projects finish
- **Professional Templates**: Branded emails with call-to-action buttons

### 3. Community Activity Feed
- **Facebook-style Feed**: All users see all activity (only non-restricted component)
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Activity Types**: Project creation, completion, estimates, invoices
- **Visual Engagement**: User avatars, activity icons, gradient colors

## üìã Prerequisites

- Supabase project with RLS enabled
- SendGrid account with API key
- Next.js 14+ application
- Existing projects and profiles tables

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup

Run the activity table setup:

```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i activity-table-setup.sql
```

This creates:
- `recent_activity` table with proper structure
- RLS policies (readable by all, writable only by service role)
- Performance indexes
- Cleanup function for old activities

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# App URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Step 3: SendGrid Setup

1. **Create SendGrid Account**: Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. **Generate API Key**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Create new API key with "Full Access"
   - Copy the key to your environment variables
3. **Verify Sender Identity**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication
   - Verify your sending domain or email address
4. **Configure Templates** (Optional):
   - The system uses built-in HTML templates
   - You can customize them in `services/email/sendgrid.ts`

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### Step 5: Test the Setup

1. **Test Database Connection**:
```sql
-- Verify table exists
SELECT * FROM recent_activity LIMIT 1;

-- Test activity insertion (as service role)
INSERT INTO recent_activity (user_id, activity_type, activity_description, metadata)
VALUES ('test-user-id', 'project_created', 'Test project created', '{"project_id": "test"}');
```

2. **Test Email Service**:
```typescript
// In your admin panel or test script
import { emailService } from '@/services/email/sendgrid';

const success = await emailService.sendProjectCreatedEmail(
  'test@example.com',
  'Test User',
  'Test Project',
  'This is a test project',
  '2024-12-31'
);
console.log('Email sent:', success);
```

## üîß Component Integration

### Dashboard Integration

The dashboard automatically includes:
- **ProjectTracker Component**: Replaces placeholder project tracker
- **RecentActivityWidget**: Shows community feed in sidebar
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds

### Admin Panel Integration

When admins create or update projects:
- ‚úÖ **Emails are sent automatically** to assigned users
- ‚úÖ **Activity is recorded** in the community feed
- ‚úÖ **No manual triggers needed** - everything is automated

## üìä Activity Types

The system supports these activity types:

| Type | Trigger | Email | Description |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `project_created` | Admin creates project | ‚úÖ | Project assignment notification |
| `project_completed` | Admin marks project complete | ‚úÖ | Completion celebration |
| `estimate_requested` | User requests estimate | ‚ùå | Estimate request activity |
| `estimate_approved` | User approves estimate | ‚ùå | Estimate approval activity |
| `invoice_paid` | Payment received | ‚ùå | Payment confirmation activity |

## üé® Customization

### Email Templates

Customize email templates in `services/email/sendgrid.ts`:

```typescript
// Modify these methods:
- generateProjectCreatedTemplate()
- generateProjectCompletedTemplate()
```

### Activity Colors & Icons

Customize activity appearance in `services/activity/recent-activity.ts`:

```typescript
// Modify these methods:
- getActivityIcon()
- getActivityColor()
- generateActivityDescription()
```

### Project Tracker Styling

Customize project cards in `components/dashboard/project-tracker.tsx`:

```typescript
// Modify:
- Status color schemes
- Progress bar gradients
- Card hover effects
- Stats display
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Logs to Monitor

- Email sending: Check console for "Email sent to..." messages
- Activity recording: Check console for "Activity recorded..." messages
- API errors: Monitor `/api/activity/feed` and `/api/admin/projects` endpoints

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**:
   - Verify SendGrid API key
   - Check sender verification status
   - Monitor SendGrid dashboard for delivery status

2. **Activity feed empty**:
   - Verify `recent_activity` table exists
   - Check RLS policies allow SELECT for authenticated users
   - Ensure activities are being inserted via service role

3. **Projects not showing**:
   - Verify user API `/api/user/projects` is working
   - Check completed projects are filtered out
   - Ensure tasks API is accessible

## üßπ Maintenance

### Automatic Cleanup

The system includes automatic cleanup of old activities:

```sql
-- Run monthly (set up as a cron job)
SELECT cleanup_old_activities();
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these for performance:
- Activity feed load times
- Dashboard project loading
- Email delivery rates
- Database query performance

## üéØ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database table created successfully
- [ ] RLS policies working correctly
- [ ] SendGrid API key configured
- [ ] Email templates rendering properly
